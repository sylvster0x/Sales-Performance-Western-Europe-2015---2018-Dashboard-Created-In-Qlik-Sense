# Sales-Performance-Western-Europe-2015---2018-Dashboard-Created-In-Qlik-Sense
This dashboard provides a comprehensive sales analysis for Western European countries from 2015 to 2018, focusing on selected product categories. The data comes from the Kaggle platform.

Looking at the data, I came to several concrete conclusions:

• $2.35M in sales results in $283k profit (12.1% margin), slightly over 8 k orders in total
 This business is definitely profitable, but the margin shows how sensitive the result is to changes in sales structure.

• Profit is highly concentrated regionally
 The Central region generates more than half of the total profit, which creates a clear dependency on a single area.

• High sales do not guarantee high profit
 The charts show many cases of strong sales combined with low (France and Italy cases) or even negative profit. 

• A small group of customers drives most of the result
 Profit distribution is highly uneven - a few customers generate most of the profit (for instance Angie Massengill ~ $5k, Ashton Charles ~$3,8k), while some clearly reduce it (like Melody Nelson ~ -$4k, Paige Bibi ~ -$2,8k)

• Product mix matters
 Technology contributes the most to profit, Office Supplies stabilizes the result, while parts of Furniture (Tables) reduce overall profitability.

When I started working with this tool, I didn’t expect the experience to be so intuitive. Working with Qlik allowed me to quickly move from high-level KPI's to detailed insights and clearly see where profit is created and where it is lost.

The dashboard will be attached in two formats - as a PNG and PDF files.
